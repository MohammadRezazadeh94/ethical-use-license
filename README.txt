About the Ethical Use License
-----------------------------
The Ethical Use License (EUL) is designed to ensure that open-source works and scientific contributions are used for the benefit of humanity, the planet, and the universe. It aims to empower ethical innovation while preventing harm and exploitation.

Why This License?
-----------------
Many open-source and free licenses provide unrestricted access, which can sometimes lead to misuse by harmful actors. The EUL strikes a balance between openness and accountability, ensuring that works are accessible but not exploitable.

2. **Prohibition of Harm**: Do not use this work to harm people, the planet, or any living being.
3. **Community Accountability**: Promote responsible and fair practices.

How to Use
